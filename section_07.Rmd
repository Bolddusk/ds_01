This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Topic 7.1 - Subsetting    
There are number of operators that can be use to extract subsets of R Objects
 - [ always return an object of the same class as the orignal; can be use to select more than one element.
 - [ [ is use to extract elements of a list or data frame; it can only be use to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily be a list or data frame.
 - $ is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name; semantics are similar to that of [ [.
 
Subsetting Vectors
```{r}
a <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f","a","b","c")
a[2]

b = a[1:4]
b

c = a[a > "c"]
c

d = a > "d"
d
```
Subsetting Matrices
```{r}
a <- matrix(1:6,2,3)
a

b <- a[1,2]
b

c <- a[1,1,drop = FALSE]
c

d = a[1,]
d

e = a[2,]
e


```
# Topic 7.2 - Subsetting Lists
 - access list in lists using index a[1] first list
 - a[1] list with name
 - a["list Name"] list with name
 
 - a[[1]] list without name
 - a[["list name"]] list without name
 - a$list_name list without name
```{r}
a <- list(weekday= 1:4,rain_prob=0.6)
#with names
a[1]
a["rain_prob"]

#without names
a[[1]]

a$weekday
a[["rain_prob"]]
```
```{r}
a <- list(weekday=1:4,rain_prob=0.6,item="Umbrella")
a
print("------")
b = a[c(1,3)]
b
```
 The [[ Operator can be used with Computed indices; $ can only be used literal names 
```{r}
a <- list(weekday = 1:4,rain_prob=0.6,item="Umbrella")
a

name <- "weekday"
a[name]

a$weekday
```
 
Subsetting Nested Elements of lists
```{r}
a <- list(a = list(10,11,12), b = c(3.14,2.81))
a[1]
print("First List and 2nd element")
a[[c(1,2)]]
```
