This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
print("hello")

```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Topic 5.1 - Object & Numbers

 - Default type for number is Numeric to make type "int" use L
 - Can't use L with Real Numbers -> 1.1  2.3 etc
 
```{r}
a = 5
class(a)

b = 5L
class(b)

c = 5.5L

d = 1/Inf
print(d)

e = NaN
class(e)


```

# Topic 5.2 - Attributes & Evaluation

R Objects can have attributes
 - names, dimmnames 
 - dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
 - class, length, other user-defined attributes/metadata
Attributes of an object can be accessed using the attributes() function

Both '=' & '<-' are assignment operators

 - : is used to print series 1:5 (Initial value : End Value) mean 1 to 5
 
```{r}
a = 1:5
print(a)
```
# Topic 5.3 - Vectors & Corecion

Creating Vectors
 - c() function can be used to create vectors
  - x <- c(1,2), x <- c(0.4,0.6)
 - vector("numeric", length = 10)

```{r}
a <- c (0.5,0.6)
a
b <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
b
c <- c("a","b","d")
c
d <- 8:20
d
e <- c(1+0i,2+5i)
e
```
When different objects are mixed in a vector, coercion occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class.
When compiler change Data Type it is called coercion

```{r}
a <- c(3.4,"b")
a
class(a)

b <- c(TRUE,FALSE,1,5)
b
class(b)

c <- c("a",TRUE,FALSE,5,8,"d")
c
class(c)
```

Explicit Coercion

```{r}
a <- -1:5
a
class(a)

b = as.numeric(a)
b
class(b)

c = as.logical(a)
# Only 0 is False all other numbers are considered TRUE
c
class(c)

d <- c("a","b","c")
e
e = as.numeric(d)
print("")
f = as.complex(d)
f

```
