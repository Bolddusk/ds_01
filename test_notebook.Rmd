This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
print("hello")

```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Topic 5.1 - Object & Numbers

 - Default type for number is Numeric to make type "int" use L
 - Can't use L with Real Numbers -> 1.1  2.3 etc
 
```{r}
a = 5
class(a)

b = 5L
class(b)

c = 5.5L

d = 1/Inf
print(d)

e = NaN
class(e)


```

# Topic 5.2 - Attributes & Evaluation

R Objects can have attributes
 - names, dimmnames 
 - dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)
 - class, length, other user-defined attributes/metadata
Attributes of an object can be accessed using the attributes() function

Both '=' & '<-' are assignment operators

 - : is used to print series 1:5 (Initial value : End Value) mean 1 to 5
 
```{r}
a = 1:5
print(a)
```
# Topic 5.3 - Vectors & Corecion

Creating Vectors
 - c() function can be used to create vectors
  - x <- c(1,2), x <- c(0.4,0.6)
 - vector("numeric", length = 10)

```{r}
a <- c (0.5,0.6)
a
b <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
b
c <- c("a","b","d")
c
d <- 8:20
d
e <- c(1+0i,2+5i)
e
```
When different objects are mixed in a vector, coercion occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class.
When compiler change Data Type it is called coercion

```{r}
a <- c(3.4,"b")
a
class(a)

b <- c(TRUE,FALSE,1,5)
b
class(b)

c <- c("a",TRUE,FALSE,5,8,"d")
c
class(c)
```

Explicit Coercion

```{r}
a <- -1:5
a
class(a)

b = as.numeric(a)
b
class(b)

c = as.logical(a)
# Only 0 is False all other numbers are considered TRUE
c
class(c)

d <- c("a","b","c")
e
e = as.numeric(d)
print("")
f = as.complex(d)
f

```

# Topic 5.4 - Matrices

Matrices are vectors with dimension attribute. The dimension attribute itself is an integer vector length of 2 (nrow,ncol)
 - matrix(3,4) means 1 column with 4 rows of 3

```{r}
a <- matrix(3,4)
a
dim(a)
b <- matrix(ncol = 3,nrow = 4)
b
dim(b)
attributes(b)
```

Assignment of data will be column wise
 - Data should be multiple of nrow
 - if data is less than the matrix it'll again start from the beginning
```{r}
a = matrix(1:6,ncol = 3,nrow = 3)
a

b = matrix(8:16,nrow = 3,ncol = 4)
b
```
Other way to make matrices
 - create vector first then assign dimensions it'll create matrix
 - When using dim() function nrow*ncol= total numbers 
```{r}
a <- 1:10
a
dim(a) <- c(5,2)
a
b <- 10:19
b
dim(b) <- c(2,5)
b
```

# Topic 5.5 - Binding & List

cbind-ing and rbind-ing
Matrices can be created by column-binding or row-binding with cbind() and rbind().
 - Size should be same of the values to be attached
 - If it isn't same it'll again start the range from beginning which is less
```{r}
a <- 1:3
b <- 20:22
cbind(a,b)

# length of D not equals to D
c = 1:4
C = 1:5
d = 10:15
rbind(c,d)

```
Lists
 - Lists are special type of vector that can contain different type of classes.
```{r}
a <- list(1,TRUE,"Hello I'm List",8,'a')
a
# We can access the specific element with index list[index number] etc a[3]
a[4]
```
# Topic 5.6 Factors

Factors are use to represent categorical data.Factors can be ordered and un-ordered. On can think of a factor as an integer vector where each integer has label.
 - Factors are treated specially by modelling functions like lm() and glm().
 - Using factors with labels is BETTER than using integers because factors are self describing; Having a variable
   that has values "Male" and "Female" is better than a variable that has values 1 and 2.
 - Levels will be sorted in Ascending Order
 - To set Levels order for Factor use "Level()" function
```{r}
a <- factor(c("Male","Female","Female","Female","Male","Female","Male","Male","Male"))
a
# table will show count for each level
table(a)
#unclass will show back-end values which are stored for data
unclass(a)
print("__________")
week = factor(c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"),levels = c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday"))
#If levels are not defined it'll show days by Ascending Order Friday,Monday etc
week
```

# Topic 5.7 Missing Values

Missing values are denoted by NA or NaN for undefined mathematical operations.
 - is.na() is use to test objects if they're NA
 - is.nan()is use to test for NAN
 - NA values have a class also, so there are integer NA, character NA, etc.
 - A NaN value is also NA but the converse is not true.
 - NaN values "NA" hain magar "NA" values "NaN" Naahin hain.
```{r}
a <- c(1,2,NA,3,NaN,NA)
is.na(a)
is.nan(a)
```
# Topic 5.8 - Data Frames

Data Frames
 - They are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length.
 - Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of    rows
 - Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of object in each column (just like lists); matrices must    have every element must be the same class.
 - Data frames also have a special attribute called row.names()
 - Data frames  are usually created by calling read.table() or read.csv()
 - Can be converted to a matrix by calling data.matrix()
```{r}
a <- data.frame(day=1:4,rain=c(T,F,F,T))
a
nrow(a)
ncol(a)
row.names(a) <- c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday",'Thursday')
a
```

# Topic 5.9 - Object Names

R Object can also have names, which is very useful for writing readable code and self-describing objects.
```{r}
a <- 1:3
names(a)
a
names(a) <- c("Col_A","Col_B","Col_C")
a

b <- list(a=1:5, b="ID",c = c("First Name","Middle Name","Last Name"))
b
# To access specific list from b  listName$subListname 
b$a

c <- matrix(1:4,nrow=2,ncol=2)
dimnames(c) <- list(c("a","b"),c("c","d"))
c
```
